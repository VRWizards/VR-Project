Project Boiler Plate for UWyo COSC 4950/5
=========================================

This is nothing more than a directory structure to use for starting a new project.  
It contains the following folders:

* **Source:** This is where you should place all of your source code.  If your project
  uses multiple languages, you may find it useful to have subdirectories, e.g.,
  Source/java, Source/html, Source/images, etc.  If you are using an IDE that has
  a project directory, you may wish to start the project here.  For example, the
  Source directory could contain an Xcode project repository or a VisualStudio
  project.

* **Documents:** Here will be the documents you write to describe your project.  The
  boiler plate includes a use case template and a sample use case.  Both of these
  are taken from [Cockburn's use cases website][1], which contains many other useful tips
  on writing effective use cases (as does his book).  The use cases are written
  down in [Markdown][2] format.  You may convert them to your word processor of
  choice.  This folder also includes a sample specification document from a real
  software company.  That is a good example of what a requirements document for this
  class should look like.

* **Resources:** This is where you can place files that are useful to your project.
  For example, you may place here helpful articles downloaded from the internet.

Before you turn in a project, be sure to modify this file!  It should have:

* The name of your group, e.g., *Programming Nirvana*, but hopefully cooler

* The names of your group members (in the order, spelling, etc., that you wish to see 
  in the official notices of this class, e.g., in the invitations to the final presentations)

* The name of your project

* A brief description (paragraph or two) of your project

Of course, those elements can change, but warn me of any substantive changes after I
approve an earlier version.

This file should also give me a good description of the files and folders that you want 
me to look for grading purposes.  For example, if your code is in Java, you may describe 
the most important Java packages and the order in which I should view them to understand 
your code.  I will probably take a look at everything that is in the repository, but your
guidance will make it easier for me to navigate the project.
